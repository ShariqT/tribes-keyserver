# Tribes Identity Registry

This is an reference implementation of a Tribes Identity Server. These servers allow people to message each other via PGP under a common domain name. 

This server allows for people to register usernames under the `tribes.ltd` domain. This implementation uses FerretDB -- a Postgres MongoDB replacement. You can use MongoDB, if you like or any other data store that respects Time-To-Live indexes.
